## Personas
#### Name & Position: Ima Mapper, undergraduate student at University of Wisconsin–Madison
Background  Description: Ima is a freshman at UW-Madison. She hasn't decided on  a major, but is taking a few courses that interest her. As part of a class project, she is learning about museums and decided she would like to know more about where artifacts come from and how they can be returned to Native American tribes. She doesn't know much about repatriation or laws regarding the return of artifacts or human remains including the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act, and she knows very little about effigy mounds in the Midwest. She would like to be able to IDENTIFY museums that have returned remains as well as COMPARE repatriation numbers between states, museums, and tribes. She would like to specifically see the TRENDS or PATTERNS in repatriation occur within Wisconsin. Her GOAL is to learn about laws such as NAGPRA and become more aware about the importance of repatriation.

## Scenarios
### Scenario 1
The reader enters the website at the title and introductory paragraph and choropleth map at the top of the page. The user is prompted to scroll down to read, and the topic of NAGPRA and museum repatriation laws and their significance. The second chapter when scrolling is on effigy mound destruction. As the user scrolls, the text will appear on the right side of the screen on desktops and in the center on mobile, with map interactives on the left, constrained to relevant locations and mounds. The user identifies the significance of specific mounds to different indigenous groups and the means or time of their destruction. The user also identifies where stolen items were stored and when they were returned. When the user scrolls past the first two chapters, the map interactive will open for exploration. They will explore the mound overlay to delineate regions of Wisconsin with clusters of mounds and then click to identify the mound information in the sidebar. The user will click on a museum of interest to them and identify the items repatriated and will associate the amount of items returned to a specific tribe based on the thickness of the flow line. The user will then click on the tribe overlay and identify other museums from which items were repatriated, and delineate geographic regions with museums containing that tribe’s objects. The user will find an object of interest, click on it, and read the information on its history, cultural significance, and repatriation status in the sidebar. The user will leave the interactive when their desire to explore for insights on mound destruction and museum repatriations is filled.
