##Persona:
###Name & Position: Ima Mapper, undergraduate student at University of Wisconsin-Madison
Background  Description: Ima is a freshman at UW-Madison. She hasn't decided on  a major, but is taking a few courses that interest her. As part of a class project, she is learning about museums and decided she would like to know more about where artifacts come from and how they can be returned to Native American tribes. She doesn't know much about repatriation or laws regarding the return of artifacts or human remains, and she knows very little about effigy mounds in the Midwest. She would like to be able to IDENTIFY museums that have returned remains as well as COMPARE repatriation numbers between states. She would like to specifically see the TRENDS or PATTERNS in repatriation occur within Wisconsin. Her GOAL is to learn about laws such as NAGPRA and become more aware about the importance of repatriation.
